    <p class="lead">How the documentation is organized¶
Django has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

Tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Web application. Start here if you’re new to Django or Web application development. Also look at the “First steps” below.
Topic guides discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
Reference guides contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Django’s machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Django works.
First steps¶
Are you new to Django or to programming? This is the place to start!

From scratch: Overview | Installation
Tutorial: Part 1: Requests and responses | Part 2: Models and the admin site | Part 3: Views and templates | Part 4: Forms and generic views | Part 5: Testing | Part 6: Static files | Part 7: Customizing the admin site
Advanced Tutorials: How to write reusable apps | Writing your first patch for Django
The model layer¶
Django provides an abstraction layer (the “models”) for structuring and manipulating the data of your Web application. Learn more about it below:

Models: Introduction to models | Field types | Indexes | Meta options | Model class
QuerySets: Making queries | QuerySet method reference | Lookup expressions
Model instances: Instance methods | Accessing related objects
Migrations: Introduction to Migrations | Operations reference | SchemaEditor | Writing migrations
Advanced: Managers | Raw SQL | Transactions | Aggregation | Search | Custom fields | Multiple databases | Custom lookups | Query Expressions | Conditional Expressions | Database Functions
Other: Supported databases | Legacy databases | Providing initial data | Optimize database access | PostgreSQL specific features
The view layer¶
Django has the concept of “views” to encapsulate the logic responsible for processing a user’s request and for returning the response. Find all you need to know about views via the links below:

The basics: URLconfs | View functions | Shortcuts | Decorators
Reference: Built-in Views | Request/response objects | TemplateResponse objects
File uploads: Overview | File objects | Storage API | Managing files | Custom storage
Class-based views: Overview | Built-in display views | Built-in editing views | Using mixins | API reference | Flattened index
Advanced: Generating CSV | Generating PDF
Middleware: Overview | Built-in middleware classes
The template layer¶
The template layer provides a designer-friendly syntax for rendering the information to be presented to the user. Learn how this syntax can be used by designers and how it can be extended by programmers:

The basics: Overview
For designers: Language overview | Built-in tags and filters | Humanization
For programmers: Template API | Custom tags and filters
Forms¶
Django provides a rich framework to facilitate the creation of forms and the manipulation of form data.

The basics: Overview | Form API | Built-in fields | Built-in widgets
Advanced: Forms for models | Integrating media | Formsets | Customizing validation
The development process¶
Learn about the various components and tools to help you in the development and testing of Django applications:

Settings: Overview | Full list of settings
Applications: Overview
Exceptions: Overview
django-admin and manage.py: Overview | Adding custom commands
Testing: Introduction | Writing and running tests | Included testing tools | Advanced topics
Deployment: Overview | WSGI servers | Deploying static files | Tracking code errors by email
The admin¶
Find all you need to know about the automated admin interface, one of Django’s most popular features:

Admin site
Admin actions
Admin documentation generator
Security¶
Security is a topic of paramount importance in the development of Web applications and Django provides multiple protection tools and mechanisms:

Security overview
Disclosed security issues in Django
Clickjacking protection
Cross Site Request Forgery protection
Cryptographic signing
Security Middleware
Internationalization and localization¶
Django offers a robust internationalization and localization framework to assist you in the development of applications for multiple languages and world regions:

Overview | Internationalization | Localization | Localized Web UI formatting and form input
Time zones
Performance and optimization¶
There are a variety of techniques and tools that can help get your code running more efficiently - faster, and using fewer system resources.

Performance and optimization overview
Geographic framework¶
GeoDjango intends to be a world-class geographic Web framework. Its goal is to make it as easy as possible to build GIS Web applications and harness the power of spatially enabled data.

Common Web application tools¶
Django offers multiple tools commonly needed in the development of Web applications:

Authentication: Overview | Using the authentication system | Password management | Customizing authentication | API Reference
Caching
Logging
Sending emails
Syndication feeds (RSS/Atom)
Pagination
Messages framework
Serialization
Sessions
